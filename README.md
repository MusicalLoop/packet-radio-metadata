# Packet Radio Metadata
Metadata for the packet radio network.

To volunteer data about nodes you know about, fork this repo, edit augments.yaml in your fork, and raise a pull request for your changes into this repo. If you aren't sure how to do this, ask for assistance in the OARC Discord server- #packet-network. Owners may edit the file directly, but please be cautious about validity, else you may break downstream applications.

In time, this data can and will be read into applications to enrich their functionality, e.g. put a node into exactly the right spot on the map.

To use the yaml file in your own application, use the direct URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Online-Amateur-Radio-Club-M0OUK/packet-radio-metadata/main/augments.yaml
